# JavaScript Info Exercises

Hi, I am [Sebastian Terleira](https://github.com/SebastianTerleira) and these are [my JavaScript exercises](https://github.com/SebastianTerleira/JavaScript.Info-Exercises/) from [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/).

If you come across them and you're learning JavaScript, try coming up with a solution yourself first and use my answers as a last resort. Some of these solutions might not be optimal or even complete or working. This is a small part of my journey learning the JavaScript language.

Each JavaScript file contains a small header, along with a description of the exercise. It will sometimes also include one or more alternative solutions.

For questions or suggestions, you can reach me on Twitter via [@SebastianTerlei](https://twitter.com/SebastianTerlei). Have fun learning JavaScript!
